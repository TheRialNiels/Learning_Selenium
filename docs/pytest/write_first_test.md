## Writing Your First Test with Pytest

To write your first test with Pytest, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Test File

Create a Python file for your test cases. Conventionally, test files are named with a prefix `test_` or suffix `_test`. For example, `test_example.py`.

### Step 2: Write Your Test Function

Write a test function using Pytest's syntax. Test functions should start with `test_` prefix.

```python
# test_example.py

def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

### Step 3: Run Pytest

Run Pytest from the command line, pointing it to the directory where your test file is located:

```
pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

Pytest will discover and execute your test function, showing the test result in the console output.

### Step 4: Review the Test Result

Pytest will display the test result, indicating whether the test passed or failed. You'll see a summary of executed tests along with any failures or errors encountered during execution.

## Conclusion

Pytest is a user-friendly and feature-rich testing framework for Python, making it easy to write and execute test cases for your Python applications. By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly get started with Pytest and begin writing effective test cases to ensure the quality and reliability of your codebase. Experiment with Pytest's various features and explore its capabilities to streamline your testing process and improve your development workflow.
