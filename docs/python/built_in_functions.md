# Built In Functions

Built-in functions in Python are functions that are always available for use, without the need to import any module. These functions are built into the Python interpreter and can be used directly in your code. They perform various common tasks and operations, ranging from mathematical calculations to data manipulation and more.

Here are some commonly used built-in functions in Python:

## Mathematical Functions

- **`abs(x)`**: Returns the absolute value of a number `x`.
- **`max(iterable)`**: Returns the largest element in an iterable.
- **`min(iterable)`**: Returns the smallest element in an iterable.
- **`pow(x, y)`** or **`x ** y`**: Returns `x` raised to the power of `y`.
- **`round(x, n)`**: Rounds a number `x` to `n` decimal places.

## Type Conversion Functions

- **`int(x)`**: Converts `x` to an integer.
- **`float(x)`**: Converts `x` to a floating-point number.
- **`str(x)`**: Converts `x` to a string.
- **`bool(x)`**: Converts `x` to a Boolean value.

## Input/Output Functions

- **`print()`**: Prints the given object(s) to the standard output.
- **`input(prompt)`**: Reads input from the user with an optional prompt.

## Sequence Functions

- **`len(sequence)`**: Returns the length of a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).
- **`sorted(sequence)`**: Returns a new sorted list from the elements of a sequence.
- **`sum(iterable)`**: Returns the sum of all elements in an iterable.

## Container Functions

- **`list(iterable)`**: Creates a list from an iterable.
- **`tuple(iterable)`**: Creates a tuple from an iterable.
- **`dict(**kwargs)`**: Creates a dictionary from keyword arguments.
- **`set(iterable)`**: Creates a set from an iterable.

## Miscellaneous Functions

- **`range(start, stop, step)`**: Returns a sequence of numbers from `start` to `stop` (exclusive) with the specified step.
- **`enumerate(iterable)`**: Returns an enumerate object containing tuples of index-value pairs.
- **`zip(*iterables)`**: Returns an iterator of tuples, where the `i`-th tuple contains the `i`-th element from each of the input iterables.

These are just a few examples of built-in functions in Python. There are many more built-in functions available, each serving its own purpose and making Python programming more convenient and efficient. You can explore the Python documentation or use the `help()` function to learn more about each built-in function and its usage.
