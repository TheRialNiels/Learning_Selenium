# Introduction to Pytest

Pytest is a powerful and popular testing framework for Python. It simplifies the process of writing and executing test cases, making it easier to perform unit, functional, and integration testing for Python applications. Pytest offers a rich set of features, including support for fixtures, parameterized testing, and plugins, making it highly flexible and customizable.

## Key Features of Pytest

1. **Simplicity**: Pytest provides a simple syntax for writing test cases, reducing boilerplate code and making tests more readable.

2. **Fixtures**: Fixtures are reusable setup and teardown functions that can be shared across multiple test cases, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

3. **Parameterization**: Pytest allows parameterizing test functions, enabling you to run the same test with different input values, which helps in testing various scenarios.

4. **Plugins**: Pytest offers a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing you to integrate with other tools, generate test reports, and more.
