# Selectors Hub

SelectorsHub helps to generate, write and verify xpath, cssSelector, Playwright selectors , jQuery, JS Path and all other possible selectors too.

SelectorsHub generates all possible selectors just in a single click. It auto generates axes based xpath relative to other element.

It works like a smart editor which auto suggests all possible functions, attributes, text and everything along with their occurrences while typing to complete Selectors like xpath & cssSelector in just less than 5 seconds. Now we need not to copy and paste attribute values from DOM anymore to build XPath and cssSelector.

It also supports axes methods like siblings, parents, childNodes, ancestors and descendants etc.

It gives the proper error message for invalid syntax like what is missing in XPath and Selector.

It supports shadow DOM, nested shadow DOM, iframe, nested iframes, SVG elements, dynamic dropdown, submenu and dynamic invisible elements too.

It is available and support almost every browser.
